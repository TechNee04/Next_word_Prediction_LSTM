# Next_word_Prediction_LSTM
This repository contains an implementation of a next word prediction model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The model is trained on text documents which is about India & the US ties, to predict the next word given a sequence of words. This project demonstrates the use of deep learning for natural language processing (NLP) tasks.
